### General Description
Fingerprint click is the simplest way to integrate biometric security to your design. The smallest optical touch fingerprint sensor in the world is featured on the click â€” GTS-511E2. The sensor takes a digital imprint of the fingerprint pattern using visible light. The board is designed to use a 3.3V power supply. The board can work as a standalone USB HID, using the Fingerprint PC application, or as an SPI slave communicating with a host MCU.
